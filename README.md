## Chota [cho-taa]: Small • Apprentice • Helper for trivial tasks

Chota is a GitHub action that you can assign trivial issue and it sends a PR with the solution. It is a small helper based on GPT-4 and GitHub Actions.

### What's so special about it?
Current transformer models make many mistakes. Chota is multi-agent, it uses GPT-4 to generate the solution and then it uses a different "role" to check the solution.

Once Chota sends a PR, you can ask it to iterate on the issue.

### How to use it?
